                <p class='main-para'>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small
                    and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                    connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p class="main-para">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
                    and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                    JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
                    for example:</p>
                <ul class='main-lists'>
                    <li class='main-list-item'>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                        control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
                    <li class='main-list-item'>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. </li>

                </header>
                <hr>
                <p class="main-para">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some
                    others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
                    type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p class="main-para">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
                    JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is
                    inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
                    declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.</p>
                <p class="main-para">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to
                    declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods
                    are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                <p class="main-para">To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first

                <p class="main-para">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                    variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p class="main-para">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign
                    ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters
                    include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p class="main-para">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can
                    also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

                <hr>
                <p class="main-para">You can declare a variable in three ways:<br><br>With the keyword <code>var</code>.
                    For example,</p>

                <pre>
                    <code class='language-javascript'>
var x = 42;
                 </code>
             </pre>


                <p class="main-para">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br><br>By
                    simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

                <pre>
                    <code class='language-javascript'>
x = 42.
                 </code>
             </pre>

                <p class="main-para">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning.
                    You shouldn't use this variant.<br><br>With the keyword let. For example,</p>

                <pre>
                <code class='language-javascript'>
let y = 13;
             </code>
         </pre>

                <p class="main-para">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.</p>


            </section>



            <section class="main-section">
                <header>
                    <h1 class="main-head">Variable scope</h1>
                </header>
                <hr>
                <p class="main-para">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global
                    variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a
                    variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.</p>
                <p class="main-para">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
                    variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                    within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

                <pre>
                    <code class='language-javascript'>
if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                 </code>
             </pre>


                <p class="main-para">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript
                    2015.</p>

                    <pre>
                        <code class='language-javascript'>
if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                     </code>
                 </pre>

                <hr>
                <p class="main-para">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                <p class="main-para">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
